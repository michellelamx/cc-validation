# Credit Card Validation

This is a script that will check credit card numbers as the user is typing, and do the following:
<ul>
  <li>Determine if the card is Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express, or other and display the corresponding icon</li>
  <li>Put spaces between groups of numbers in the appropriate place based on card type</li>
  <li>Determine how long the CVV should be based on the type of card</li>
  <li>Restrict the input to numbers only</li>
  <li>Restrict the total number of digits that can be entered</li>
  <li>Support for when a user copy and pastes their credit card number</li>
</ul>
